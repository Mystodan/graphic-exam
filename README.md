# Graphics Exam : BLOCK OUT (By Daniel - Group 15)

**Notes**
Hi! first commit is a little weird seeing as I adapted the code from the Pacman project and didnt commit until now. This is because I did not see that i was supposed to commit here until later on. I apologize.

**Controls:**
- WASD or the arrow keys moves you around the screen til you hit a wall or another block.
- space descend untill you place a block.
- esc to exit application

### How to run
1. Clone the project.
2. Run the commands "git submodule init" and "git submodule update" to download submodules in /external.
3. Create a "build" folder. Then either generate and configure cmake cache using the cmake-gui, or run the command "cmake .." using git-bash from the build folder.
4. Open "Graphics-Exam-BlockOut.sln", from within the build folder.
5. In Visual Studio, right click "Graphics-Exam-BlockOut.sln" in the solution explorer and select "Set as Startup Project".

**OTHER INFORMATION**

-   **Do not open Inspera in multiple tabs, or log in on multiple devi**ces, simultaneously. This may lead to errors in saving/submitting your answer.

-   **Get an overview of the question set** before you start answering the questions.

 

-   **Read the questions **carefully, make your own assumptions and specify them in your answer. Only contact academic contact if you think there are errors or insufficiencies in the question set.

 

**Cheating/Plagiarism: **The exam is an individual, independent work. Examination aids are permitted. All submitted answers will be subject to plagiarism control. Read more about cheating and plagiarism here. You are allowed to use original code you have developed during the assignments, however, any external source that has been directly added (copied) to your assignments, and therefore to the exam, needs to be properly referenced and might affect to your grade if your own contribution is not enough.
 

You have unrestricted use of the code **that you (or your group) **originally** developed** for the assignments (also if you extended or corrected it after the assignments). If your assignments contain code from other sources (e.g., labs or other sources) and want to include it, you need to cite it properly, however, depending on the size an importance of the code, this could be considered as less contribution from your side and affect your scoring. Obvious and short code snippets are safe to use and cite without affecting your scoring (as a rule of thumb consider the functions of the labs safe to use; larger pieces of code or pieces of code that manages more complex aspects can affect your scoring).



**Weighting:** The exam consists of 5 tasks with 2 extra tasks. Extra tasks are only to give extra point, this means that a student could still achieve the maximum grade with a perfect scoring in the 5 regular tasks only. The scoring moves in a scale 0-10 (+3 possible extra points); Scoring from 0-4.99 will be graded as F, while scoring from 5-10 will be graded as E-A depending on the scoring achieved. Exceeding 10 points will be considered also as A.
